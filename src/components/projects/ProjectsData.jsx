            global income distribution. It was built by me and four classmates
            using React and D3.js. I was mainly responsible for the React part
            of the project. Follow the links above for a live demo and a video

            Slipped Away is a puzzle game where the player moves between two
            parallel worlds, the world of the living and the world of the dead,
            with the goal of reconnecting with a grandmother that has passed on.
            The two worlds are imperfect reflections of one another, demanding
            the player to navigate a cycle of death and rebirth to solve the
            puzzles. This was a group work where I was the art director,
            responsible for the design of the characters and the background, as
            well as character animations. The art was created using Procreate
            and the animations using Unityâ€™s 2D Animation package.

            developing the model and presenters. This was my first experience
            with web development and it had me very interested in a future

            Hide & Meet is a mobile app prototype designed through a double
            diamond process with the purpose of supporting introverted practices
            in a hypothetical world where all people are introverts. It offers
            party guests a unique way to socialize, decreasing the risks of
            face-to-face rejection and lack of conversation starters. Using AR
            technology, users can scan their surroundings with their mobile
            camera to discover virtual objects placed in the room by other
            guests. If a user finds an object of interest and its creator is
            open to meeting, the object becomes both the meeting point and a
            conversation starter. Want to learn more about the design process?

            accessible web applications. In that report, I propose a study to
            investigate how the KTH learning management system could be improved
            for people with cognitive disabilities. I linked it as a bonus

            In the final project of a KTH course on accessible design, my team
            of four assessed the information screens at the Play Beyond Play
            exhibition at Tekniska Museet and prototyped a new design with a
            focus on enhanced user experience for visitors with dyslexia. Our
            work was guided by accessibility guidelines, and we conducted user
            testing on both the original design and our new prototype. For an
            overview of our process and a visual of the prototype, check out the

            The purpose of this study that I conducted with three classmates was
            to explore the impact of color similarity on memorability of website
            content and user experience. Using a Wix website template as a base,
            two identical websites were created, differing only in their color
            scheme. Then twelve participants took part in experiments and data
            was gathered for comparison. While the results of the small-scale
            study were far from statistically significant, I learned a lot about
            the process of conducting perceptual experiments. Take a look at the
            poster for a summary or read the full report for more information.

            In this study, my team of three extended an existing bachelor's
            thesis on communicating weight in virtual reality. To their already
            implemented virtual environment where users throw spheres at a
            target, we added auditory and/or haptic feedback to respond to ball
            movement. The goal was to investigate if varying frequencies and
            amplitudes in the feedback could convey a sense of weight difference
            between balls. Models for auditory and haptic feedback were designed
            based on prior research on cross-sensory correspondences between
            audio, haptics, and weight. User testing revealed that both audio
            and haptics effectively communicate ball weight, but there were no
            notable differences in performance between the different feedback
            systems.

            process involving chest compressions, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

            using a variety of sensors, actuators, and everyday materials,
            including an Easter egg for the head. This is among my favorite
            projects, because of the creative freedom and the introduction to a
            lot of new programming languages, software, and hardware. Find the
            code and an in-depth description of the project in the GitHub
