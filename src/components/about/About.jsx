                  I am a KTH student with a bachelor in Media Technology,
                  currently halfway through my first year at the Interactive
                  Media Technology masterâ€™s programme. This means I have
                  experience in designing, developing and evaluating interactive
                  products as well as researching topics related to
                  human-computer interaction
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  My dream job involves front-end development or UX/UI-design
                  and allows me to explore my creative sides. Topics I find
                  important, and have taken additional courses in, are
                  accessibility and sustainability. Other than that, I have a
                  big interest in painting and sports activities of all sorts.
                  Please have a look at my CV or scroll down to see some of my
                  projects.
